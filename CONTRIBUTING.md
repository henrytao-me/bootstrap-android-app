Before submitting a new issue, please check the following guideline.

## Describe your issue as much as possible

This is number one rule. It can save a ton of times if the ticket is clear and more details.

## Follow coding convention

Consistency will increase readability and mantainable of source code. I embeded `codeStyleSettings.xml` in the repo. If you are using Android Studio, it's pretty easy. Thanks!
